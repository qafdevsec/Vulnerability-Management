# Vulnerability-Management
This is a tool for managing vulnerabilities detected for different projects/sites. It allows to create pentest tasks for each project and assign them to a group of pentesters. In each pentest task, you can create different reports each will a list of detected vulnerabilities. As a result, you can monitor and manage all projects vulnerabilities, running pentest tasks, pentest reports, their automatic versioning, and how they are mitigated over time. Also, it allows assessing what list of projects was vulnerable to a specific vulnerability. <br /> <br />
You can find its demo on: [vulnerability.tantaneh.com](http://vulnerability.tantaneh.com)
